I am currently working as a project researcher in the field of Human-Computer Interaction [HCI] at [Sony Computer Science Laboratories](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/) (Tokyo, Japan) since 2021.08. I work on novel types of bodies relying on the integration of humans and computers, under the direction of [Dr. Kasahara Shunichi](https://shunichikasahara.com/).
